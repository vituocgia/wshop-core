Wshop 0.7.1 release notes
=========================

This is Wshop 0.7.1, a nano-release to squash one gremlin in 0.7 that affects
`wshop-paypal`_.

Bug fixes
=========

This release `makes a change`_ to the checkout session mixin which allows a basket
to be explicitly specified by subclasses of the checkout ``PaymentDetails``
view class. This is required when a different basket to ``request.basket`` is
intended to be used in a preview (this is what `wshop-paypal`_ needs to
do).
