Wshop 0.5.3 release notes
=========================

This is Wshop 0.5.3, a bug-fix release for Wshop 0.5.  

The only change from 0.5.2 is to `pin the dependency on Haystack to version 2.0.0`_.  
Previously, ``setup.py`` specified ``2.0.0-beta`` but this beta release has now
been removed from PyPi, stopping Wshop from installing correctly.
